Astronomy Domine (Barrett) 8:31

Lime and limpid green, a second scene 
A fight between the blue you once knew. 
Floating down, the sound resounds 
Around the icy waters underground. 
Jupiter and Saturn, Oberon, Miranda and Titania. 
Neptune, Titan, Stars can frighten. 

Blinding signs flap, 
Flicker, flicker, flicker blam. Pow, pow. 
Stairway scare Dan dare who's there? 

Lime and limpid green, the sounds surronds 
The icy waters under 
Lime and limpid green, the sounds surronds 
The icy waters underground.
